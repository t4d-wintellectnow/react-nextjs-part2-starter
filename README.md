## Getting the Project

1. Install [Node.js version 10.16.3](https://nodejs.org/dist/v10.16.3/) on your computer. Also, install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on your computer. All three installs are supported on Windows, MacOS and popular Linux distros.

2. Either clone the project or download the source zip. To clone the project [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) will need to be installed on your machine. If you download the source zip, you will need to unzip the source with the appropriate program on your computer. If you do not have an unzipping program, click here to download [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org) for Windows and Linux or [Keka](https://www.keka.io) for MacOS.

3. After you unzip you will need to restore the dependencies for both the React + Nex.js project. Replace the folder name `ReactNextAppStarter` below with the path of the folder which contains the React + Next.js project. The folder which contains the project has the file `package.json` located within it.

```
cd ReactNextAppStarter

npm install
```

3. With Visual Studio Code, open the folder which contains the `package.json` file.

4. Open the Extensions sidebar window in VSCode using the menu bar (`View` -> `Extensions`). Search for and install the following extensions:

    - Debugger for Chrome (msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome) - supports JavaScript code debugging in VSCode
    - ESLint (dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) - provides linting of JavaScript code in VSCode
    - Bracket Pair Colorizer (coenraads.bracket-pair-colorizer) - Provides nice editor decorations for showing paired brackets
    - Color Highlight (naumovs.color-highlight) - displayed HTML Color HexCode in a font which matches the described color

5. Using the menu bar (`View` -> `Terminal`), open the Terminal window (usually appears at the bottom).

6. To start the React + Next.js application, run the following command:

```
npm run dev
```
